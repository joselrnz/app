# Circuit Board Texture

Please save the circuit board image as `circuit-floor.png` in this directory.

The image should be:
- The blue circuit board pattern with glowing nodes and microchips
- Ideally seamless or tileable for best results
- Recommended size: 1024x1024 or 2048x2048 pixels
- Format: PNG with transparency if possible

The RubiksCube component will automatically load this texture and use it for the floor reveal effect.
